# Libary_1.0
Library 1.0 is a small pet project, implemented on the basis of MVC pattern, which aims to consolidate the practical skills in working with the Spring Framework.

This project implements an electronic library account and consists of two main components: members and books. You can add new, modify, delete members or books. You can assign a book to a specific person, as well as see the books that are taken by a specific person. The forms for creating new members or changing existing members or books apply field validation by specified conditions.

The project uses the following technologies: Spring MVC, JDBC Template, Thymeleaf, Spring Validator, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap.

A logical continuation of this project is Library 2.0 (https://github.com/AntonU91/Libary_2.0), where Spring Data JPA technology is used instead of JDBC Template, and a number of useful features are added (sorting, pagination, book search by title, book rent overdue indicator).
